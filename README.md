**C++ Code Written for Arduino Uno**

**Motor driver code written for "Power Vector" Formula NULL team**

Formula NULL was a hack-a-thon aimed at designing a small competition car (max. 60cm x 60cm x 60cm volume) using e-waste. It took place on May 31st and June 1st. Any changes after that point were done with the intention of learning and having fun. 

**As of June 2nd:**
- Rewriting some parts of the code to work on the STM32 F401RE instead of the Arduino Uno
- Working on assessing any issues within the motor code and improving reliability to learn more about the car's handling.   
- Adding variable sensitivity to steering so that at higher speeds the servo controlling the direction of the car becomes less responsive.
- Creating state machines that allow the car to go into different operational modes based on user input
